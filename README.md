Gilded Age
==========
by Michael Nutt <michael@nuttnet.net>

Gilded Age is a Safari extension meant to work with www.gilt.com, the flash sample sale site.  It changes the aesthetics slightly and adds a few additional features. It is particularly suited for larger monitors.

Features
--------

* When viewing product lists, shows as many as will fit in the window horizontally
* Shows a larger product photo on product detail page
* Shows sizing notes directly on the product detail page, rather than in Sizing popup.
* Condenses navigation to give more screen real estate to products
* Consolidates sales containing multiple brands into a single page

Requirements
------------

Gilded Age requires Safari 5.0 or later.
